 ### Capstone Project Roadmap
 
## Event Ease

Concept:Event Ease is a full-stack event booking platform that enables users to browse events, select seats, and book tickets effortlessly. It features user authentication (JWT), event management, seat selection, booking confirmation, and optional payment integration (Stripe/PayPal).

Users can view available events, reserve seats, and track their bookings via a personalized dashboard. Admins have access to an admin panel for managing events, bookings, and users. Built with React (frontend), Node.js & Express (backend), and MongoDB (database), Event Ease ensures a secure, scalable, and user-friendly experience, making event reservations simple and efficient for both attendees and organizers.

Tech Stack:
Frontend → React.js + Vite (for fast, interactive UI)
Backend → Node.js + Express.js (for handling API requests)
Database → MongoDB + Mongoose (for storing users, events, and bookings)
Authentication → JWT (JSON Web Token) (for secure login/signup)
UI Styling → Tailwind CSS (for responsive design)
State Management → React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
Routing → React Router (for navigation)
API Requests → Axios (for fetching & sending data)
Storage → Firebase (for event images and assets)
Payment Integration (Optional) → Stripe/PayPal (for secure transactions)

## Capstone project ##

## GET REQUEST API ##

This GET /events router is used to retrieve the list of all events available in the Event Booking Website. When a user accesses this route, the server fetches all event data from the database and sends it back as a response. This is helpful for users who wish to view all the upcoming events.

## Steps for Setting Up the GET ##

1.Inside this file,I import the necessary controller (e.g., event controller) and set up the GET /events route.

2.This route will listen for incoming requests at /api/events and forward the request to the event controller for processing.

3.The route will forward the request to the event controller that handles fetching events from the database.

## GET Handling: ##

1.The eventController will fetch all events from the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

2.If the data retrieval is successful, it will return the list of events.

3.If there is an error (e.g., database issue), it will return an error message.

## Send Response: ##

1.After processing the request, the router sends a response back to the client.

2.Success responses return the list of events in JSON format.

3.Error responses will provide an error message (e.g., failed database query).

  {
    "_id": "60c72b1f4f1a2f4b3c8c8d8d",
    "title": "Music Concert",
    "date": "2022-12-25T19:00:00.000Z",
    "location": "Stadium ABC",
    "availableSeats": 100,
    "description": "A grand music concert featuring top artists."
  },

    "location": "Conference Hall XYZ",
    "availableSeats": 200,
    "description": "A conference on the latest in technology."
  }
]

## POST REQUEST API ##

This POST /signup router handles user registration for the Event Booking Website. When users submit their details (username, email, and password), this router will pass the data to the signup controller, which processes the request by checking the uniqueness of the email, hashing the password, and saving the new user to the database.

### Steps for Setting Up the POST ###

1.Inside this file,I import the necessary controller (e.g., signup controller) and set up the POST /signup route.

2.This route will listen for incoming requests at /api/auth/signup and call the corresponding controller to process the signup logic.

3.The request will forward the data to the signup controller for processing.

4.The signup controller will check if the provided email already exists in the database.

5.If the email is unique, it will hash the password using bcrypt and then save the user data in the database.

6.After processing the request, the router sends a response back to the client.

7.Success responses return the user data (excluding the password), while error responses explain what went wrong (e.g., email already exists or internal server error).


## Update Event API (PUT Request) ##

This API endpoint allows you to update the details of an existing event using its unique identifier. The endpoint expects a PUT request to the URL path /events/:id, where :id is the ID of the event you want to update. In the request body, you can provide updated values for the event's properties such as title, Date, location, availableSeats, and description

1.The Update Event API endpoint handles HTTP PUT requests at the route /events/:id, where :id is the unique identifier of the event to be updated.

2.When a request is received, the server uses the event ID from the URL parameters to find and update the corresponding event in the database.

3.The update operation uses findByIdAndUpdate with options { new: true, runValidators: true } to return the updated document and ensure all schema validations are enforced.

4.This API enables clients to modify one or multiple fields of an existing event such as changing the title, date, location, available seats, or description.

5.This API enables clients to modify one or multiple fields of an existing event such as changing the title, date, location, available seats, or description.

6.On successful update, the API returns a 200 status code and the updated event object in JSON format. -->
